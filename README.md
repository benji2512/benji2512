### Hi there ðŸ‘‹   
My name is Ben, pleased to meet you :smiley:  
I am a graduate of Computer Applications and Software Engineering from Dublin Ciy University. I am 26 years old with a love of coding and a passion for football.  
Currently looking for a new job.  
In the past year I have volunteered as a Football Coach with the [Wicklow and District Schoolboys/Girls League](http://www.wdsl.ie) and spent 3 week overseas volunteering with [Nurture Africa](https://nurtureafrica.ie). I taught IT Skills alongside personal vegetable plot growing techniques while over in Nansana, you can find out more at [bensnurtureafricatrip.ie](https://bensnurtureafricatrip.com)  
  
### What am I coding at the moment?

- Planning various ideas that I will get around to doing at some stage in my life ðŸ˜…
