### What am I up to ?
- ðŸ”­ My current project is a android/IOS app for Landscapers or ground maintenance crews to accurately measure contracted their chemical to water mix should be to spray a certain area using a napsack sprayer(hand pump sprayer for your back).  It is currently in the requirememnts gathering and upskilling phase.  
- I'm going through the tedious job of cleaing up my repos. This means that empty or nonsense repos are being removed, relevent private repos will be make public(If available to) and updating pinning ones that best showcase my work
